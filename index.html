          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Identification of the Social Justice Issue</h2>
          <p class="lead">
  <br>Imagine you're walking down a street in Philadelphia. You had just spent ten dollars on two slices of pizza. You’re stuffed. But then you stop and notice a homeless mom and her daughter on the street corner with a cardboard sign that says “My daughter needs to eat.” At this moment you feel two conflicting emotions. One is guilt. You feel bad that you just ate more than you need while others do not have that opportunity to eat at all. But on the other hand, you don’t know how you would go about helping them. What if you gave them money and the mother spent it irresponsibly? So instead of helping, you just walk on. This is something that has happened to all of us, and we all feel uncomfortable. But now you have an option. That option is Wash on Wheelz.<br>
	<br>Our world is by no means perfect, and there is a lot more than just one or two issues. We could have gone in any number of ways. But through a lengthy process of coming up with ideas, then eliminating them we finally came to a consensus. We started with preventative health care but the idea evolved into homelessness. The reason we chose homelessness as our topic is because it is a huge problem facing the U.S. today. The 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report found that on a single night, 549,928 people were homeless. Of those people, 32% lived in unsheltered places. So many people do not even have the bare essentials.<br>
	<br>It is a common misconception that a person becomes homeless due to their choices, and that it is the fault of the homeless individual. This is known as the Myth of Choice. In reality, there are a lot of reasons one might be homeless. In Confronting the Myth of Choice: Homelessness and Jones v. City of Los Angeles, former Harvard alum Tanene Allison gives her personal account from when she was homeless. She states that not only her, but many other teens at her shelter “...were failed by abusive households and overwhelmed child service systems.” Allison had seen the world of the homeless and “the hallowed halls of the Ivy league” but in spite of seeing the policies to protect and help the homeless, she knows the system is flawed. This is in response to the common idea that homelessness is the result of one’s own choices. However homelessness is an unmethodical thing.<br>
 <br>Another problem related to the homeless is homeless teens. Of 549,928 observed people, 22% were under the age of 18 (Project H.O.M.E., 2017). This could mean they are with or without a parent. Not only that but in 2009, 1 in 50 homeless were unaccompanied minors (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2009). In other words there are children under the age of 18 that are without any adults at all. This held great significance to us because of the fact that we ourselves are that age.<br> 
<br>For a homeless teen, it would be very hard to be self sufficient, as they must go to school, do homework, study, and get good grades. That is one of their best chances to get out of their current situation, and it is difficult to do without the proper hygiene.In a survey conducted by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in 2004, 50 cities were surveyed, and in every one, the ones who had the need of shelter exceeded the amount of resources and shelter available (National Coalition for the Homeless, 2009). While there is an abundance of organizations solely dedicated to ending homelessness, the problem never has enough support.<br>
<br>We wanted to help limit and erase homelessness. Doesn’t everyone though? We had to think of a logical way to go through with our idea. Our group started to brainstorm what exactly homeless people need. We started with the obvious answer of “We should give homes to those without one.” However, we realized, “More than that, they need jobs.” Going even further, we discovered that not a lot of people who are homeless have access to places to wash themselves. That leads to a bit of a problem. In order to be hygienic, they need money; to get money, they need a job; to get a job they need to look nice, but to look nice, they need to be hygienic. We realized it is a never ending loop that needs to change.<br>
<br>Difficulties in attaining basic hygeine add to homeless hardships. In a group of homeless youth, it was confirmed that one of the largest obstacles and restraints from attaining and maintaining employment was unavailability to showers before work (Bender, Thompson, & McManus, 2007). If one has access to a shower, the doors to employment are instantly more open. Additionally, according to studies, “Providers must attend first to the immediate needs of persons who are homeless. Offering basic items such as food, clothing, and hygiene supplies can initiate the necessary mechanisms for establishing communication and trust” (Bender, Thompson, & McManus, 2007). Hygienic issues in homeless individuals are one of their largest restraints, and any aid in this area can make a monumental difference. Illnesses can also be 	prevented by proper hygiene, as pediculosis is preventable by weekly change of clothes, including underwear and socks, and foot problems can be prevented by cleaning feet regularly (Raoult, 2001). Once showering and other hygienic needs are met, the lives of those people can change for the better.<br>
<br>Overall, hygiene is an important thing for those without homes. Without proper hygiene, people have a hard time finding opportunities like meaningful careers. Employers are prone to hire people that look cleaner over people that don’t. This makes it very hard for people who are homeless to get hired, as they do not have much access to things like showers and washing machines. Proper hygiene, such as bathing at least every three days and wearing clean clothes on a regular basis, is also a big contributor to good health and positive self-image. Even the small things, like washing your hands, can make a big difference, but people without shelter don’t always have access to clean water. This is why our organization is dedicated to providing opportunities of cleaning to those without.
